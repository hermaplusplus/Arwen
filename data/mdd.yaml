A: "Five (or more) of the following symptoms have been present during the same 2-week period and represent a change from previous functioning; at least one of the symptoms is either (1) depressed mood or (2) loss of interest or pleasure."
Anote: "Note: Do not include symptoms that are clearly attributable to another medical condition."
A1: "Depressed mood most of the day, nearly every day, as indicated by either subjective report (e.g., feels sad, empty, hopeless) or observation made by others (e.g., appears tearful). (Note: In children and adolescents, can be irritable mood.)"
A2: "Markedly diminished interest or pleasure in all, or almost all, activities most of the day, nearly every day (as indicated by either subjective account or observation)."
A3: "Significant weight loss when not dieting or weight gain (e.g., a change of more than 5% of body weight in a month), or decrease or increase in appetite nearly every day. (Note: In children, consider failure to make expected weight gain.)"
A4: "Insomnia or hypersomnia nearly every day."
A5: "Psychomotor agitation or retardation nearly every day (observable by others, not merely subjective feelings of restlessness or being slowed down)."
A6: "Fatigue or loss of energy nearly every day."
A7: "Feelings of worthlessness or excessive or inappropriate guilt (which may be delusional) nearly every day (not merely self-reproach or guilt about being sick)."
A8: "Diminished ability to think or concentrate, or indecisiveness, nearly every day (either by subjective account or as observed by others)."
A9: "Recurrent thoughts of death (not just fear of dying), recurrent suicidal ideation without a specific plan, or a suicide attempt or a specific plan for committing suicide."
B: "The symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning."
C: "The episode is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance or another medical condition."
Cnote1: "Note: Criteria A-C represent a major depressive episode."
Cnote2: "Note: Responses to a significant loss (e.g., bereavement, financial ruin, losses from a natural disaster, a serious medical illness or disability) may include the feelings of intense sadness, rumination about the loss, insomnia, poor appetite, and weight loss noted in Criterion A, which may resemble a depressive episode. Although such symptoms may be understandable or considered appropriate to the loss, the presence of a major depressive episode in addition to the normal response to a significant loss should also be carefully considered. This decision inevitably requires the exercise of clinical judgment based on the individual's history and the cultural norms for the expression of distress in the context of loss."
Cnote2sub: "In distinguishing grief from a major depressive episode (MDE), it is useful to consider that in grief the predominant affect is feelings of emptiness and loss, while in an MDE it is persistent depressed mood and the inability to anticipate happiness or pleasure. The dysphoria in grief is likely to decrease in intensity over days to weeks and occurs in waves, the so-called pangs of grief. These waves tend to be associated with thoughts or reminders of the deceased. The depressed mood of an MDE is more persistent and not tied to specific thoughts or preoccupations. The pain of grief may be accompanied by positive emotions and humor that are uncharacteristic of the pervasive unhappiness and misery characteristic of an MDE. The thought content associated with grief generally features a preoccupation with thoughts and memories of the deceased, rather than the self-critical or pessimistic ruminations seen in an MDE. In grief, self-esteem is generally preserved, whereas in an MDE feelings of worthlessness and self-loathing are common. If self-derogatory ideation is present in grief, it typically involves perceived failings vis-à-vis the deceased (e.g., not visiting frequently enough, not telling the deceased how much he or she was loved). If a bereaved individual thinks about death and dying, such thoughts are generally focused on the deceased and possibly about 'joining' the deceased, whereas in an MDE such thoughts are focused on ending one's own life because of feeling worthless, undeserving of life, or unable to cope with the pain of depression."
D: "At least one major depressive episode is not better explained by schizoaffective disorder and is not superimposed on schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorder, delusional disorder, or other specified and unspecified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders."
E: "There has never been a manic episode or a hypomanic episode."
Enote: "Note: This exclusion does not apply if all of the manic-like or hypomanic-like episodes are substance-induced or are attributable to the physiological effects of another medical condition."
CRP: "The diagnostic code for major depressive disorder is based on whether this is a single or recurrent episode, current severity, presence of psychotic features, and remission status. Current severity and psychotic features are only indicated if full criteria are currently met for a major depressive episode. Remission specifiers are only indicated if the full criteria are not currently met for a major depressive episode."
CRPnote1: "For an episode to be considered recurrent, there must be an interval of at least 2 consecutive months between separate episodes in which criteria are not met for a major depressive episode. The definitions of specifiers are found on the indicated pages."
CRPnote2: "If psychotic features are present, code the 'with psychotic features' specifier irrespective of episode severity."
CRP2: "In recording the name of a diagnosis, terms should be listed in the following order: major depressive disorder, single or recurrent episode, severity/psychotic/remission specifiers, followed by as many of the following specifiers without codes that apply to the current episode (or the most recent episode if the major depressive disorder is in partial or full remission). Note: The specifier 'with seasonal pattern' describes the pattern of recurrent major depressive episodes."
S0: "" # key only
S0a: "Single episode"

S1: "With anxious distress: Anxious distress is defined as the presence of at least two of the following symptoms during the majority of days of the current major depressive episode (or the most recent major depressive episode if major depressive disorder is currently in partial or full remission) or current persistent depressive disorder:"
S11: "Feeling keyed up or tense."
S12: "Feeling unusually restless."
S13: "Difficulty concentrating because of worry."
S14: "Fear that something awful may happen."
S15: "Feeling that the individual might lose control of himself or herself."
S1S: "" # key only
S1A: "Mild: Two symptoms."
S1B: "Moderate: Three symptoms."
S1C: "Moderate-severe: Four or five symptoms."
S1D: "Severe: Four or five symptoms and with motor agitation."
S1note: "Note: Anxious distress has been noted as a prominent feature of both bipolar and major depressive disorder in both primary care and specialty mental health settings. High levels of anxiety have been associated with higher suicide risk, longer duration of illness, and greater likelihood of treatment nonresponse. As a result, it is clinically useful to specify accurately the presence and severity levels of anxious distress for treatment planning and monitoring of response to treatment."
S2: "With mixed features:"
S2A: "At least three of the following manic/hypomanic symptoms are present during the majority of days of the current major depressive episode (or the most recent major depressive episode if major depressive disorder is currently in partial or full remission):"
S2A1: "Elevated, expansive mood."
S2A2: "Inflated self-esteem or grandiosity."
S2A3: "More talkative than usual or pressure to keep talking."
S2A4: "Flight of ideas or subjective experience that thoughts are racing."
S2A5: "Increase in energy or goal-directed activity (either socially, at work or school, or sexually)."
S2A6: "Increased or excessive involvement in activities that have a high potential for painful consequences (e.g., engaging in unrestrained buying sprees, sexual indiscretions, or foolish business investments)."
S2A7: "Decreased need for sleep (feeling rested despite sleeping less than usual; to be contrasted with insomnia)."
S2B: "Mixed symptoms are observable by others and represent a change from the person's usual behavior."
S2C: "For individuals whose symptoms meet full criteria for either mania or hypomania, the diagnosis should be bipolar I or bipolar II disorder."
S2D: "The mixed symptoms are not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication or other treatment)."
S2Dnote: "Note: Mixed features associated with a major depressive episode have been found to be a significant risk factor for the development of bipolar I or bipolar II disorder. As a result, it is clinically useful to note the presence of this specifier for treatment planning and monitoring of response to treatment."
S3: "With melancholic features:"
S3A: "One of the following is present during the most severe period of the current major depressive episode (or the most recent major depressive episode if major depressive disorder is currently in partial or full remission):"
S3A1: "Loss of pleasure in all, or almost all, activities."
S3A2: "Lack of reactivity to usually pleasurable stimuli (does not feel much better, even temporarily, when something good happens)."
S3B: "Three (or more) of the following:"
S3B1: "A distinct quality of depressed mood characterized by profound despondency, despair, and/or moroseness or by so-called empty mood."
S3B2: "Depression that is regularly worse in the morning."
S3B3: "Early-morning awakening (i.e., at least 2 hours before usual awakening)."
S3B4: "Marked psychomotor agitation or retardation."
S3B5: "Significant anorexia or weight loss."
S3B6: "Excessive or inappropriate guilt."
S3Bnote: "Note: The specifier 'with melancholic features' is applied if these features are present at the most severe stage of the episode. There is a near-complete absence of the capacity for pleasure, not merely a diminution. A guideline for evaluating the lack of reactivity of mood is that even highly desired events are not associated with marked brightening of mood. Either mood does not brighten at all, or it brightens only partially (e.g., up to 20%-40% of normal for only minutes at a time). The 'distinct quality' of mood that is characteristic of the 'with melancholic features' specifier is experienced as qualitatively different from that during a nonmelancholic depressive episode. A depressed mood that is described as merely more severe, longer lasting, or present without a reason is not considered distinct in quality. Psychomotor changes are nearly always present and are observable by others.\n\nMelancholic features exhibit only a modest tendency to repeat across episodes in the same individual. They are more frequent in inpatients, as opposed to outpatients; are less likely to occur in milder than in more severe major depressive episodes; and are more likely to occur in individuals with psychotic features."
S4: "With atypical features: This specifier is applied when these features predominate during the majority of days of the current major depressive episode (or the most recent major depressive episode if major depressive disorder is currently in partial or full remission) or current persistent depressive disorder."
S4A: "Mood reactivity (i.e., mood brightens in response to actual or potential positive events)."
S4B: "Two (or more) of the following:"
S4B1: "Significant weight gain or increase in appetite."
S4B2: "Hypersomnia."
S4B3: "Leaden paralysis (i.e., heavy, leaden feelings in arms or legs)."
S4B4: "A long-standing pattern of interpersonal rejection sensitivity (not limited to episodes of mood disturbance) that results in significant social or occupational impairment."
S4C: "Criteria are not met for 'with melancholic features' or 'with catatonia' during the same episode."
S4Cnote: "Note: 'Atypical depression' has historical significance (i.e., atypical in contradistinction to the more classical agitated, 'endogenous' presentations of depression that were the norm when depression was rarely diagnosed in outpatients and almost never in adolescents or younger adults) and today does not connote an uncommon or unusual clinical presentation as the term might imply.\n\nMood reactivity is the capacity to be cheered up when presented with positive events (e.g., a visit from children, compliments from others). Mood may become euthymic (not sad) even for extended periods of time if the external circumstances remain favorable. Increased appetite may be manifested by an obvious increase in food intake or by weight gain. Hypersomnia may include either an extended period of nighttime sleep or daytime napping that totals at least 10 hours of sleep per day (or at least 2 hours more than when not depressed). Leaden paralysis is defined as feeling heavy, leaden, or weighted down, usually in the arms or legs. This sensation is generally present for at least an hour a day but often lasts for many hours at a time. Unlike the other atypical features, pathological sensitivity to perceived interpersonal rejection is a trait that has an early onset and persists throughout most of adult life. Rejection sensitivity occurs when the person is and is not depressed, though it may be exacerbated during depressive periods."
S5: "With psychotic features: Delusions and/or hallucinations are present at any time in the current major depressive episode (or the most recent major depressive episode if major depressive disorder is currently in partial or full remission). If psychotic features are present, specify if moodcongruent or mood-incongruent:"
S5A: "With mood-congruent psychotic features: The content of all delusions and hallucinations is consistent with the typical depressive themes of personal inadequacy, guilt, disease, death, nihilism, or deserved punishment."
S5B: "With mood-incongruent psychotic features: The content of the delusions or hallucinations does not involve typical depressive themes of personal inadequacy, guilt, disease, death, nihilism, or deserved punishment, or the content is a mixture of mood-incongruent and mood-congruent themes."
S6: "With catatonia: This specifier is applied to the current major depressive episode (or the most recent major depressive episode if major depressive disorder is currently in partial or full remission) if catatonic features are present during most of the episode. See criteria for catatonia associated with a mental disorder in the chapter 'Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorders.'"
S7: "With peripartum onset: This specifier is applied to the current major depressive episode (or the most recent major depressive episode if major depressive disorder is currently in partial or full remission) if onset of mood symptoms occurs during pregnancy or in the 4 weeks following delivery."
S7note: "Note: Mood episodes can have their onset either during pregnancy or postpartum. About 50% of postpartum major depressive episodes begin prior to delivery. Thus, these episodes are referred to collectively as peripartum episodes.\n\nBetween conception and birth, about 9% of women will experience a major depressive episode. The best estimate for prevalence of a major depressive episode between birth and 12 months postpartum is just below 7%.\n\nPeripartum-onset mood episodes can present either with or without psychotic features. Infanticide (a rare occurrence) is most often associated with postpartum psychotic episodes that are characterized by command hallucinations to kill the infant or delusions that the infant is possessed, but psychotic symptoms can also occur in severe postpartum mood episodes without such specific delusions or hallucinations.\n\nPostpartum mood (major depressive or manic) episodes with psychotic features appear to occur in from 1 in 500 to 1 in 1,000 deliveries and may be more common in primiparous women. The risk of postpartum episodes with psychotic features is particularly increased for women with prior postpartum psychotic mood episodes but is also elevated for those with a prior history of a depressive or bipolar disorder (especially bipolar I disorder) and those with a family history of bipolar disorders.\n\nOnce a woman has had a postpartum episode with psychotic features, the risk of recurrence with each subsequent delivery is between 30% and 50%. Postpartum episodes must be differentiated from delirium occurring in the postpartum period, which is distinguished by a fluctuating level of awareness or attention.\n\nPeripartum-onset depressive disorders must be distinguished from the much more common 'maternity blues,' or what is known in lay terms as 'baby blues.' Maternity blues is not considered to be a mental disorder and is characterized by sudden changes in mood (e.g., the sudden onset of tearfulness in the absence of depression) that do not cause functional impairment and that are likely caused by physiological changes occurring after delivery. It is temporary and self-limited, typically improving quickly (within a week) without the need for treatment. Other symptoms of maternity blues include sleep disturbance and even confusion that can occur shortly after delivery.\n\nPerinatal women may be at higher risk for depressive disorders due to thyroid abnormalities as well as other medical conditions that can cause depressive symptoms. If the depressive symptoms are judged to be due to another medical condition related to the perinatal period, depressive disorder due to another medical condition should be diagnosed instead of a major depressive episode, with peripartum onset."
S8: "With seasonal pattern: This specifier applies to recurrent major depressive disorder."
S8A: "There has been a regular temporal relationship between the onset of major depressive episodes in major depressive disorder and a particular time of the year (e.g., in the fall or winter)."
S8Anote: "Note: Do not include cases in which there is an obvious effect of seasonally related psychosocial stressors (e.g., regularly being unemployed every winter)."
S8B: "Full remissions also occur at a characteristic time of the year (e.g., depression disappears in the spring)."
S8C: "In the last 2 years, two major depressive episodes have occurred that demonstrate the temporal seasonal relationships defined above and no nonseasonal major depressive episodes have occurred during that same period."
S8D: "Seasonal major depressive episodes (as described above) substantially outnumber the nonseasonal major depressive episodes that may have occurred over the individual's lifetime."
S8note: "Note: The specifier 'with seasonal pattern' can apply to the pattern of major depressive episodes in major depressive disorder, recurrent. The essential feature is the onset and remission of major depressive episodes at characteristic times of the year. In most cases, the episodes begin in fall or winter and remit in spring. Less commonly, there may be recurrent summer depressive episodes. This pattern of onset and remission of episodes must have occurred during at least a 2-year period, without any nonseasonal episodes occurring during this period. In addition, the seasonal depressive episodes must substantially outnumber any nonseasonal depressive episodes over the individual's lifetime.\n\nThis specifier does not apply to those situations in which the pattern is better explained by seasonally linked psychosocial stressors (e.g., seasonal unemployment or school schedule). Major depressive episodes that occur in a seasonal pattern are often characterized by loss of energy, hypersomnia, overeating, weight gain, and a craving for carbohydrates.\n\nThe prevalence of winter-type seasonal pattern appears to vary with latitude, age, and sex. Prevalence increases with higher latitudes. Age is also a strong predictor of seasonality, with younger persons at higher risk for winter depressive episodes."
S9A: "In partial remission: Symptoms of the immediately previous major depressive episode are present but full criteria are not met, or there is a period lasting less than 2 months without any significant symptoms of a major depressive episode following the end of such an episode."
S9B: "In full remission: During the past 2 months, no significant signs or symptoms of the disturbance were present."
SA: "Severity is based on the number of criterion symptoms, the severity of those symptoms, and the degree of functional disability."
SA1: "Mild: Few, if any, symptoms in excess of those required to make the diagnosis are present, the intensity of the symptoms is distressing but manageable, and the symptoms result in minor impairment in social or occupational functioning."
SA2: "Moderate: The number of symptoms, intensity of symptoms, and/or functional impairment are between those specified for 'mild' and 'severe.'"
SA3: "Severe: The number of symptoms is substantially in excess of that required to make the diagnosis, the intensity of the symptoms is seriously distressing and unmanageable, and the symptoms markedly interfere with social and occupational functioning."
